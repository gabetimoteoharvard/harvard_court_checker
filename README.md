Background worker that instantly sends me an email whenever an indoor tennis court at Harvard University becomes available to book.

It runs every 5 minutes or so using Selenium and sees if there are any courts available on a list of dates that I provided it. If there are, it sends me an email alerting me so. This helps me
know whenever a court is available so that I can book it instantly and not lose it to someone else. It's helpful because they become available at seemingly random times and I can't really predict when to check.
